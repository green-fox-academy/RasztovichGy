UART properly
Problem with polling UART handling

In a previous workshop we have written an UART handler application. In that we used the UART interface as a standard input and output. There is a problem with that method.

Look at this code. Run it on your ATmega168PB Xplained board, and send two string after each other. You will notice that the second string is not complete.

If the processor does something time-consuming while a strings arrives on the UART than characters will be lost. This is a big issue, but there is a solution for this.

If somehow we could fire an interrupt if a character arrives on UART and we could put this character in a buffer, than the problem could be solved.
UART receive with interrupt

Let's implement a circular buffer for the UART receiver. We will also use receive interrupt to put received characters to the buffer.
